## Features

- At the beginning, ZigZag welcomes you with the start menu.
- There are currently 2 levels but many more levels can be created with more difficult settings, complex maps etc.
- Game control is very simple since you only need to press the screen and change ball direction from left to right or vica versa.
- I made the collectible awards torus shaped moving and rotating items with code (Primitives.cs script).

- I added a particle system for when the player loses. This occurs when the ball leaves the map. I used raycast detector to detect if the ball has left the platform.
